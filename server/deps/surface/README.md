# Surface

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/msaraiva/surface.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/msaraiva/surface)
[![Hex.pm version](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/surface.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/surface)

A component based library for **Phoenix LiveView**.

Built on top of the new [LiveComponent](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveComponent.html)
API, Surface provides a more declarative way to express and use components in Phoenix.

Full documentation and live examples can be found at [surface-demo.msaraiva.io](http://surface-demo.msaraiva.io).

A VS Code extension that adds support for syntax highlighting is available at
[marketplace.visualstudio.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msaraiva.surface).

### Example

![Example](images/example.png?raw=true)

A lot of the concepts behind it were borrowed from some of the most popular frontend
solutions like `React` and `Vue.js`.

## How does it work?

At compile time, Surface translates components defined in an extended HTML-like syntax
into regular Phoenix templates. It also translates standard HTML nodes allowing us to
extend their behaviour adding new features like syntatic sugar on attributes definition,
directives, static validation and more.

In order to have your code translated, you need to use the `~H` sigil when defining your templates.

## Features

  * **Components as modules** - they can be stateless, stateful, data-only or compile-time
  * **Declarative properties** - explicitly declare the inputs (properties) of each component (like React)
  * **An HTML-centric** templating language with built-in directives (`:for`, `:if`, ...) and syntactic sugar for attributes (inspired by Vue.js)
  * **Contexts** - allows parent components to share data with its children without passing them as properties
  * **Compile-time checking** of components and their properties
  * **Integration with editor/tools** for warnings, syntax highlighting, jump-to-definition, auto-completion and more

> **Note:** Some of the features are still experimental and subject to change.

## Installation

Install Phoenix LiveView following the [installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html).
Then add `surface` to the list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:surface, "~> 0.1.0-alpha.1"}
  ]
end
```

In order to have `~H` available for any Phoenix view, add the following import to your web
file in `lib/my_app_web.ex`:

```elixir
  # lib/my_app_web.ex

  ...

  def view do
    quote do
      ...
      import Surface
    end
  end
```

## Defining components

To create a component you need to define a module and `use` one of the available component types:

  * **Surface.Component** - A stateless component.
  * **Surface.LiveComponent** - A live stateful component.
  * **Surface.LiveView** - A wrapper component around `Phoenix.LiveView`.
  * **Surface.MacroComponent** - A low-level component which is responsible for translating its own content at compile time.

### Example

```elixir
  # A stateless component

  defmodule Button do
    use Surface.Component

    property click, :event
    property kind, :string, default: "is-info"

    def render(assigns) do
      ~H"""
      <button class="button {{ @kind }}" :on-phx-click={{ @click }}>
        <slot/>
      </button>
      """
    end
  end

  # A live stateful component

  defmodule Dialog do
    use Surface.LiveComponent

    @doc "The title of the dialog"
    property title, :string, required: true

    data show, :boolean, default: false

    def render(assigns) do
      ~H"""
      <div class={{ "modal", "is-active": @show }}>
        <div class="modal-background"></div>
        <div class="modal-card">
          <header class="modal-card-head">
            <p class="modal-card-title">{{ @title }}</p>
          </header>
          <section class="modal-card-body">
            <slot/>
          </section>
          <footer class="modal-card-foot" style="justify-content: flex-end">
            <Button click="hide">Ok</Button>
          </footer>
        </div>
      </div>
      """
    end

    # Public API

    def show(dialog_id) do
      send_update(__MODULE__, id: dialog_id, show: true)
    end

    # Event handlers

    def handle_event("show", _, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, show: true)}
    end

    def handle_event("hide", _, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, show: false)}
    end
  end

  # A live view component

  defmodule Example do
    use Surface.LiveView

    def render(assigns) do
      ~H"""
      <Dialog title="Alert" id="dialog">
        This <b>Dialog</b> is a stateful component. Cool!
      </Dialog>

      <Button click="show_dialog">Click to open the dialog</Button>
      """
    end

    def handle_event("show_dialog", _, socket) do
      Dialog.show("dialog")
      {:noreply, socket}
    end
  end
```

## Static checking

Since components are ordinary Elixir modules, some static checking is already provided
by the compiler. Additionally, we added a few extra warnings to improve user experience.
Here are some examples:

### Module not available

![Example](images/module_not_available.png?raw=true)

### Missing required property

![Example](images/required_property.png?raw=true)

### Unknown property

![Example](images/unknown_property.png?raw=true)

## Tooling

Some experimental work on tooling around the library has been done. Here's a few of them:

### VS Code

- [x] Syntax highlighting

### ElixirSense

- [x] Jump to definition of modules (components)
- [ ] Jump to definition of properties
- [ ] Auto-complete/suggestions for properties (WIP)
- [ ] Show documentation on hover for components and properties

### Other tools

Having a standard way of defining components with typed properties allows us to
enhance tools that introspect information from modules. One already discussed was
the possibility to have `ex_doc` query that information to provide standard
documentation for properties, events, slots, etc.
