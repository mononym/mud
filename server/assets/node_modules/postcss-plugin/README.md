# PostCSS FPF plugin

This PostCSS plugin converts football club names (in your css code's declarations) into colors.

The club names currently supported are:

- benfica: #ff0000
- porto: blue
- sporting: green

This plugin for the PostCSS preprocessor heavily based on [Sara Vieira's postcss-caralho](https://github.com/SaraVieira/postcss-caralho) in terms of not only the plugin's code but also testing. This project owes much to it!
